Assignments of foodvisor

In this branch, I submitted 3 solutions :

The first one is a brute force solution inpired by "Where's Waldo" game. I show to the algorithm what a tomato looks like, and it finds it among many other vegetables. To load this first solution just enter into your keyboard :

``` python basic_solution.py ```

The second one is an adaptation of a Yolo algorithm to my problematic which consists of detecting tomatoes. To load this second solution just enter into your keyboard :

``` python yolo_tomato.py ```

The third solution consists of a function named "has_tomatoes" that allows us to detect a tomatoes one videos and images. To load this third solution just enter into your keyboard :

``` python has_tomatoes_function.py ```

Don't forget to modify the dataset path and load the requirements.txt file.
